# [Project 1: Car Value Prediction - Webscraping, Model Building & Deployment](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Non-Finance/Car_Project)

Created a tool to predict the value of a car given its mileage, bhp, litre engine, age etc...

* Webscraped data of over 200,000 car prices from AutoTrader
  * AutoTrader has a maximum output of 100 webpages per search so needed to work my way around this

* Built a model to predict car value using ensembling with hyperparameter tuning
 * Achieved an R^2 score of 0.973

* Created an application using flask to allow a user to input information and receive a valuation for their car, as shown below:

# [Project 2: Time Series Analysis in R](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Finance/Time%20Series%20Analysis%20R)

Created a sequence of R notebooks showing ARIMA, GARCH, Cointegration and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for financial data.

# [Project 3: Heart Disease Death Prediction](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/blob/master/Non-Finance/Heart%20Disease%20Death%20Prediction.ipynb)

Used feature generation on a small dataset (299 rows) in order to generate few but very powerful features.

Implemented a voting classifier in order to achieve an accuracy of ~85%


# [Project 4: Clustering in Portoflio Construction](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/blob/master/Finance/Cluster%20Portfolio%20Construction.ipynb)

Used clustering to form groups of stocks within a list, then used Cointegration to find pairs of stocks for pairs trading then made a simple backtester for a trading strategy involving these pairs 


## Other

I have done plenty of other Data Science projects too! 

These include projects on House Pricing, Heart Disease Death Prediction, NLP, Premier League Badge Prediction, FIFA 20 Player Rating Prediction, SVC's in Trading, Using a Linear Regression on Fundamental data of companies, the use of Monte Carlo Methods in Finance, and the efficient Frontier of Portolfios.
