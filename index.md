# [Project 1: Car Value Prediction - Webscraping, Model Building & Deployment](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Non-Finance/Car_Project)

Created a tool to predict the value of a car given its mileage, bhp, litre engine, age etc...

* Webscraped data of over 200,000 car prices from AutoTrader
  * AutoTrader has a maximum output of 100 webpages per search so needed to work my way around this

* Built a model to predict car value using ensembling with hyperparameter tuning
 * Achieved an R^2 score of 0.973

* Created an application using flask to allow a user to input information and receive a valuation for their car, as shown below:

# [Project 2: Neural Networks solving Differential Equations - *Coming Soon*]()

Student Speaker Project at Warwick Data Science Society.

# [Project 3: Time Series Analysis in R](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Finance/Time%20Series%20Analysis%20R)

Created a sequence of R notebooks showing ARIMA, GARCH, Cointegration and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for financial data.

# [Project 4: Heart Disease Death Prediction](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/blob/master/Non-Finance/Heart%20Disease%20Death%20Prediction.ipynb)

Used feature generation on a small dataset (299 rows) in order to generate few but very powerful features.

Implemented a voting classifier in order to achieve an accuracy of ~85%

## Other

I have done plenty of other Data Science projects too! 

These include projects on House Pricing, NLP, Premier League Badge Prediction, FIFA 20 Player Rating Prediction, SVC's in Trading, Using a Linear Regression on Fundamental data of companies, the use of Monte Carlo Methods in Finance, the efficient Frontier of Portolfios and clustering and cointegration in pairs trading.
