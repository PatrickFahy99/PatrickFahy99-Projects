# Patrick Fahy Projects
A summary of some of my data science projects

# [Project 1: Car Value Prediction - Webscraping, Model Building & Deployment]
* Webscraped data of over 200,000 car prices from AutoTrader
  * AutoTrader has a maximum output of 100 webpages per search so needed to work my way around this

# [Project 2: Clustering in Portoflio Construction]

# [Project 3: Time Series Analysis in R]


I have done plenty of other Data Science projects too! Have a look in my 'Projects' repo.
