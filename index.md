# Patrick Fahy Data Science Projects
A summary of some of my data science projects

# [Project 1: Car Value Prediction - Webscraping, Model Building & Deployment](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Non-Finance/Car_Project)

Created a tool to predict the value of a car given its mileage, bhp, litre engine, age etc...

* Webscraped data of over 200,000 car prices from AutoTrader
  * AutoTrader has a maximum output of 100 webpages per search so needed to work my way around this

* Built a model to predict car value using ensembling with hyperparameter tuning
 * Achieved an R^2 score of 0.973

* Created an application using flask to allow a user to input information and receive a valuation for their car, as shown below:
 

# [Project 2: Time Series Analysis in R](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Finance/Time%20Series%20Analysis%20R)

Created a sequence of R notebooks showing ARIMA, GARCH, Cointegration and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for financial data.


# [Project 3: Clustering in Portoflio Construction](https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/blob/master/Finance/Cluster%20Portfolio%20Construction.ipynb)

Used clustering to form groups of stocks within a list, then used Cointegration to find pairs of stocks for pairs trading then made a simple backtester for a trading strategy involving these pairs 


I have done plenty of other Data Science projects too! 

These include projects on House Pricing, Heart Disease Death Prediction, NLP, FIFA 20 Player Rating Prediction, SVC's in Trading, Using a Linear Regression on Fundamental data of companies, the use of Monte Carlo Methods in Finance, and the efficient Frontier of Portolfios.
