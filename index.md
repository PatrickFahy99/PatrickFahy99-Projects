# Patrick Fahy Projects
A summary of some of my data science projects

# [Project 1: Car Value Prediction - Webscraping, Model Building & Deployment] (https://github.com/PatrickFahy99/Projects/tree/master/Non-Finance/Car_Project)
Created a tool to predict the value of a car given its mileage, bhp, litre engine, age etc...

* Webscraped data of over 200,000 car prices from AutoTrader
  * AutoTrader has a maximum output of 100 webpages per search so needed to work my way around this

* Built a model to predict car value using ensembling with hyperparameter tuning
 * Achieved an $R^2$ score of $0.973$

* Created an application using flask to allow a user to input information and receive a valuation for their car, as shown below

I have done plenty of other Data Science projects too! Have a look in my 'Projects' repo.
